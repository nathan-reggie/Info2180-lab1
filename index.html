                I am 20 years old and I am the eldest of my siblings. I enjoy playing video games, reading books and learning new things.
                I am interested in Web Development because I had the pleasure of interning at a local tech company that worked on Web Dev. 
                Through this work experience, my interest in the topic has risen, hence why I am taking this course
